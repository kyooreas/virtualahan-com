> This will be a fully-coded version of the website 'virtualahan.com'. Currently, the website is built using Wordpress. 
> The goal is to create a different version of the website without using a CMS like Wordpress to check and compare if it can be faster and accessible than the current wordpress website.
> The vision is to achieve a fully accessible website.
> Hopefully, by making this public, web developers with the same advocacy as Virtualahan, can also help or guide us to make this project successful.

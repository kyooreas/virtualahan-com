- The goal is to make www.virtualahan.com website fast and fully accessible.
- Hopefully, by making this public, anyone with the same advocacy as Virtualahan, can also help or guide us to make this project successful.

## Phases

- Phase 1
  - Improve accessibility.
  - Improve the current website www.virtualahan.com which is built with Wordpress.
  

- Phase 2
  - Improve performance.
  - Transfer hosting to Azure App Service.

- Phase 3
  - Explore other development approach other than Wordpress or CMS and check if it can make it even better.

## Getting started
